Being an expert beginner
October 10, 2013

One thing I pride myself on is my ability to learn new skills quickly and become productive in a new work place in a very short amount of time. I like to think of myself as the oxymoronic "expert beginner".

In my first two jobs out of college I was quite successful at gaining domain knowledge and getting up to speed on necessary technologies and tools in a very short time frame. In both of these jobs I feel I became a highly productive member of the team within just a couple of months and felt as though I was contributing more than was expected of somebody with my level of experience. I want to write this blog post to propose some explanations of how I think I achieved this and hopefully encourage other people starting a new career to apply some of these techniques to maximise productivity as quickly as possible.

I firstly want to point out that I do not believe that I needed to work very hard in order to achieve what I had. I also don't want this to sound like a motivation talk, with some kind of unrealistic notion that one can achieve anything if they put their mind to it. These are mostly just some tricks I think can help people starting out in a new role to come closer to realising their potential. Also I have only really applied these techniques in quite junior roles which were essentially graduate software developer roles.

## The Best Resource You Have Is Your Colleagues

Asking questions can sometimes be difficult especially if you are working with people you don't know very well. It may often feel like you are bothering them or perhaps you just feel silly asking questions, because you have some ridiculous idea that you are just supposed to know this stuff. The best advice I could possibly give somebody who is in a new team, trying to catch up to the people they work with, is to just ask lots and lots of questions. You may end up annoying the people you work with, but that is their problem and in reality if they are senior employees then it is part of their job to help junior employees become productive and useful. If you are not asking questions and just trying to figure out everything on your own you will very often end up spending much more time and producing work of a much lower quality than if you were to just ask for help. People often have the mentality that you should just google for the answer instead of asking, while this may be true sometimes, there is often a great deal more you will get by asking the people you work with. Quite often they will be able to put the answer in the context of the work you are doing. Also they may detect that you are heading down a bad path and steer you towards a better solution without having to waste a great deal of time and doing something wrong.

Being a beginner implies that you are not going to know everything but that you will be getting better over time. Therefore your team should recognise that you are going to need help initially and that the help they give you is actually an investment in the team as you will end up being a much more productive member of the team under the right guidance. In my experience asking for assistance is almost always better than spending a huge amount of time on a problem that is really easy for somebody else to just explain to you. That doesn't mean you should just get someone else to do it for you, but rather you should use every opportunity you have to ask for help as a time for you to learn how they think about problem solving and the specific solution to the problem so that you will be ready solve similar problems swiftly in the future.

My favourite thing to do is to insist on making sure the person fully explains what they are thinking to me. Whenever someone tells me something without explaining how they reached that conclusion I always ask them to explain their reasoning to me. The other trick I use to make sure I have fully understood them is to explain it back to them. As far as I am concerned if I can't explain it to them then I don't understand it. So after I think I've got it I just jump in and explain to them what they were explaining to me. This is not only an excellent opportunity to reinforce the knowledge I have just gained, but also a chance for them to correct any misunderstandings or incorrect inferences in my thinking. This is a common learning technique used in class rooms, for instance when a teacher asks the students questions about what they are teaching them just after teaching them the answer. I just take this approach to my work and I find myself able to gain a much deeper understanding than I otherwise would be able to. As well as learning more, myself, it gives feedback to the teacher about how effectively they are communicating ideas to you.

## Push Yourself

Another thing I find really helps me learn quickly is to pick up tasks that are slightly too hard for me or involve a component about which I have no previous knowledge. This forces me to learn new things and also forces me to work a little harder than if I just did little tasks that I already know how to do. If you can, always keep looking out for tasks that sound challenging and interesting and try to be the first to raise your hand to take them on. Don't worry you won't be expected to complete them without any help, but at least you will most likely end up learning way more than if you just took all the easy jobs.

## Pair Programming

Ok so this mainly applies to software developers, but I guess a similar mentality may be applicable in another job in which you are working closely with colleagues. Pair programming is by far the most effective way to gain knowledge on a new project/technology. That being said you should be very proactive in your first couple of months in a job to be regularly asking people to let you pair with them on a task.

When I am pair programming I find it is very useful to ensure that I never allow the other person to just start coding without explaining what they are doing. I also find that the more senior person may be inclined to just do the work themselves and not share the programming time. They should realise that they are there to teach you so when they are going off on a tangent and you aren't following you should probably ask them to stop and explain what they are doing. Letting them just write code under some kind of false assumption that you won't be able to understand what they are doing, or belief that it is more productive, is a huge waste of time. Pair programming does not mean just sitting next to somebody and watching them code. It should be about sharing knowledge and improving quality, by having twice the brain power at every step.

Another thing I like to do is just simply take over. If you think you can see what they are about to do next just grab the keyboard and do it. That way you will be able to demonstrate that you are following their train of thought and if you get a little stuck they can always just point you in the right direction.

I have also had to learn new programming languages in both my last two jobs. So while trying to learn about the project and its code base I was also just trying to learn the nuances of a new programming language. If I knew what I was trying to do, but I just didn't know the exact way to do it in that language I would very often just write down pseudocode. It's an awesome situation to be in where your mistakes have absolutely no consequence, because someone is there to just fix them up for you. This was really effective because then the more experienced person I was pairing with could easily just take the keyboard back and turn it into real code and I could very quickly find out how to do something in that programming language and not be derailed from the problem I was trying to solve.

## The Basics

1. Don't be scared to ask questions
2. Work with smart people
3. Insist on understanding the answer and always explain it back to the teacher
4. Push yourself
5. You shouldn't be expected to know everything, nobody does
6. You aren't stupid if you don't know the answer, you wouldn't have the job if you were stupid
7. Avoid people that don't want to help and utilise the people that do
8. Make mistakes when you are lucky enough to have somebody there to correct them for you
9. Every job is way more fun when you challenge yourself
10. Beginner means that you are going to get better
11. Your team will thank you for asking lots of questions when you quickly become a domain/project expert
