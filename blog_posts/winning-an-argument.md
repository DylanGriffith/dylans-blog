Why do people think that you can win an argument?
2014-03-16

I am the kind of person who finds himself in a lot of arguments. I enjoy getting into arguments for a few reasons. Firstly it is fun. But most importantly it is the best opportunity to learn the gaps in your knowledge and specifically find out if you are wrong about something before it actually matters.

What I particularly dislike, though, is that people seem to think arguments have winners. That seems to be a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of arguments. I mean if you are arguing with someone so that you can say "I won, you lose!" then that seems pretty self serving and unproductive. When you argue with someone it should be because you hope that you are helping them learn something or correct a mistaken belief. You are arguing because you believe the person you are arguing with has the capacity to have their mind changed, such that they may leave the argument knowing more than they did previously and being more "right", for lack of a better word.

Actually the purpose of any arguments should be that both parties leave having a fuller knowledge of the topic of the argument than they did going in.

People may have gotten this strange notion of winning and losing from organized debate. While arguments do seem on the face of it, like an organized debate, they are there to serve a different purpose. Organized debate is a place where parties demonstrate their arguing skills, rather than specifically try to change their opponents mind.

I think this is important because I might be able to have more productive arguments with people if not as many people think that changing their mind was an indication that they have lost the argument.
