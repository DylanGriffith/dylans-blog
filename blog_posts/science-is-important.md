Science is Important
Sunday, October 20, 2013

Science isn't always right and no scientists would ever tell you to take their word for it on any topic. Scientific ideas evolve and change to match new evidence. The purpose of the scientific method is specifically to attempt to eliminate ideas that are in contradiction to the evidence.

Science is the best tool we currently have for solving many of the worlds most challenging problems. One of the reasons for this is that scientific papers cannot merely assert conclusions. They must show the data to support conclusions. Scientific papers cannot just be published, they need to be reviewed and undergo scrutiny so as to avoid publishing misguided conclusions. Scientific papers cannot state their data without describing their experimental techniques.

This combination of powerful techniques is what has led to a very accurate understanding of some of the most interesting and important problems in history. Thanks to our ability to reproduce and scrutinize scientific data we are able to achieve a high level of confidence that is also justifiable by the simplicity with which an idea can be shown to be false under the scientific method.

Scientists regularly disagree on many things, but science continues to steer them all toward the truth. Science also attempts to approach new ideas with the belief that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

This should make it very obvious that when every credible scientist agrees on an issue as important as climate change, and when every piece of peer reviewed literature on the topic reaches the same conclusion, it is probably a good idea to listen to it.

If you are under the impression that there is some kind of controversy or disagreement about the scientific evidence for climate change then you have probably been mislead by the media. The reason for this may not be your fault. Unfortunately the media does not understand that not all ideas are equally credible. It is not necessarily honorable to give both sides of an argument the same amount of air time. Some times one side of the argument is just a distraction from reality. Being neutral on issues such as whether the earth is flat, whether evolution is accurate, whether the earth revolves around the sun or whether dinosaurs existed is not good journalism and only serves to confuse and misrepresent the state of knowledge for civilized society.

People must insist that decisions surrounding scientific issues be driven by science, not opinion. We must demand that politicians making statements in contradiction to the science be held accountable to those statements. If they refuse or unable to produce any evidence for a claim that violates the  most agreed upon scientific ideas then they should not be taken seriously.

I would happily listen to people's 'opinions' on these kinds of issues if I hadn't found myself in a world that is full of intelligent people dedicating their efforts to understanding the universe through the use of the scientific method and publishing their findings openly with the simple goal of reducing the need for naive conjecture. Put another way I don't think that anybody's opinion should be given as much value as evidence.

> The thing that I worry about more is the media’s bias toward fairness. Nobody uses the word lie anymore. Suddenly, everything is "a difference of opinion." If the entire House Republican caucus were to walk onto the floor one day and say "The Earth is flat," the headline on the New York Times the next day would read "Democrats and Republicans Can’t Agree on Shape of Earth." I don’t believe the truth always lies in the middle. I don’t believe there are two sides to every argument.
