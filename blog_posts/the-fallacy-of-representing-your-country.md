The Fallacy Of Representing Your Country
2012-07-31

The phrase "representing your country" seems to be frequently used when discussing the Olympics. I would argue that this phrase is misleading. In science the term "representative" implies that the sample set follows a similar distribution to the complete set. Ironically athletes are exactly not a representative sample of the greater population, they are chosen for their extraordinary abilities.

The reason I find this interesting is that we are quick to claim that the successful, modest, charismatic and kind Olympians are "representing" us, but when one fails to display all these characteristics we want to make comments like "they shouldn't be representing us" and we like to divorce ourselves from these individuals (for example athletes that are rude, violent or openly arrogant). This is the equivalent to openly falsifying data.

The point is that our country isn't represented by these statistical outliers, if you want to claim some correlation to these individuals then you should also correlate yourself to the outlying murderers, rapists and, probably more accurately, racists.

The great shame is that people seem to be more concerned with how they are represented by the achievements of people they have never even met than they are about their own achievements.
