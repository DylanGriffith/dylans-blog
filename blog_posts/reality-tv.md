Stop Watching Reality TV!

I should first point out that I watch a lot of TV. I love TV. I watch good TV and bad TV. Funny TV, sad TV, lame TV. I'm not a TV snob. I don't think we all need to be watching intellectual TV that is exceptionally written and produced with only the most highbrow jokes. However, I do think people need to stop watching reality TV!

My reasoning for disliking reality TV is not because it is bad, but rather because it is dishonest. Almost all of the popular reality TV today is heavily scripted and planned. I hope that if audiences were aware of this we would ask these TV producers to stop insulting us by hyping their badly acted drama under the guise of reality.

## Cooking Shows
My Kitchen Rules is a cooking show in which every single episode involves the contestants managing to serve up their dishes with around 1 second to spare on the clock, after having hours to cook. The entire time they are plagued by drama between the partners and, to make it easier for us to grasp, it is narrated in the first person present tense, by what is almost certainly a scripted, well paid, amateur chef turned actor.

We see the contestants rushing around stressed with camera angles constantly reminding us "this is pretty dramatic", with shots of judges and friends and family cheering and announcing timelines cut into the action sequence with no real evidence (but every reason to think otherwise) that they were even filmed at the same time.

Finally the contestants manage to finish cooking with but a second to spare and their exhaustion and relief is perfectly mirrored in the narration shots filmed in a different location at a different time.

## Talent Shows
It's interesting to watch how much singing shows have evolved in the last decade since Australian Idol. Australian Idol was popular for a while, but people got bored of a new fairly good singer demonstrating through the medium of music that they are a little better than the other singers on the show. Australian Idol tried to create drama by adding tough judges which occasionally said controversial things about contestants.

Today we have X Factor. This show pretends to be a singing contest. The fact is it is a drama. Contestants are selected based on background story, appearance and general likeability. They are then given a huge amount of coaching and investment. Their performances, far from focusing on raw singing ability, are a spectacular event with singers accompanied by backup singers, backup dancers, fireworks and often those ropes that people attach to in plays to appear to be flying (wow that was the best description I could come up with).

Then to add insult to arena spectacular, the judges stand up dancing throughout the performances. Finally we are reassured by all the judges that these are indeed the most extraordinary performers they have ever had on this show (that's fine nobody was going to rewatch last years series in which they said the exact same thing).

I was always surprised how quickly people got over it in 2011 when they found out that Australia's Got Talent lied to us about a 14 year old singing a song he wrote. In fact (unsurprisingly) the song was written by older more experienced professional songwriters, no doubt paid for by Channel 7. The show's host stating in no uncertain terms (but definitely false terms) "Doing a song he has actually written himself called ‘Yes I Am’, and proving why he deserves to be here tonight, is Jack Vidgen".

Then the public's outrage probably lasted all of about 1 week, mostly reassuring themselves that "he's still very good at singing for his age", when they found out actually he may have had some help and the TV producers were well aware of this the entire time.

This is exactly the kind of insulting dishonesty that is encouraging me to write this mostly pointless rant about "reality" TV.
